metodology:
	how the output is captured

RSTDP:
	- delayed c 
		- justification is ignoring immediate reward, but only for a state that follows 		allowing the new state to propagate
	- neuron model:
		iaf exp -> infinitely short rise time, showing more time differences as result of noise
		


	- normalization (- avg reward)
	- weight clamping
	- reward to current preslikava
	- primerjava z negativnimi rewardi?

	- pong task je simplified ker ne rabi vedeti svojega prejsnjega stanja
	- a task for recurrent maybe

- ocenjevanje performanca za PONG




iaf alpha -> times are more synchronized, especially on multiple layers: maybe more research. This paper proposes iaf exp, but also questions the syncrony emergence:
